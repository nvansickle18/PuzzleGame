# PuzzleGame

This project is a simple proof-of-concept game that I have created. This game has a character, which is a block(20x20px) and travels throughout the game area(800x800px). The character must find a key, and then unlock the door, and must find the different ways to go about achieving the key. It is a puzzle game, and is not meant to be difficult as of now. This is just the beginning, and many more levels can be made.
